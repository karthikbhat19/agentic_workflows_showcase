      "Question: Which residential college is best for incoming engineering students?\n",
      "Orginal Answer: Each of our 10 residential colleges have their perks based on proximity to students’ ideal amenities. For the most part, you should not be choosing based on accessibility to the engineering school, as many lower division courses are spread out around campus. Most undergraduate students don’t spend much time at Baskin Engineering until their 3rd and 4th year. \n",
      "Answer: There isn't a specific \"best\" residential college for incoming engineering students at UCSC, as each of the 10 colleges has its own advantages. It's recommended not to choose based on proximity to the engineering school since lower-division courses are spread across campus. Most engineering students spend significant time at Baskin Engineering during their 3rd and 4th years.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Does UCSC offer a pre-med program? A business program? What about preparation to become a teacher?\n",
      "Orginal Answer: UCSC offers a B.A. and B.S. major in global and community health, which provide excellent preparation for applying to medical school, and a business management economics program. In addition, UCSC offers a minor in education, as well as a graduate teaching credential program. We offer a Literature & Education 4+1 pathway to help aspiring teachers get their undergraduate degree and teaching credential faster. For potential teachers in the STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics), UCSC is home to the innovative Cal Teach program.\n",
      "Answer: UCSC offers a MA/Credential Program for teacher preparation, which includes multiple subjects for K-8 and single subjects for grades 7-12. For pre-med and business programs, the context does not provide specific details. Therefore, I don't know the exact offerings for pre-med and business at UCSC.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is UC Santa Cruz's grading policy for undergraduates?\n",
      "Orginal Answer: Undergraduates are graded on a traditional A-F (4.0) scale. Students may elect a pass/no pass option for no more than 25 percent of their coursework. Several majors further limit use of pass/no pass grading.\n",
      "Answer:  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Do you take fall term grades into account?\n",
      "Orginal Answer: Students applying for fall admission are required to complete all in-progress fall coursework with a grade of C or better.\n",
      "Answer:  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: I had good grades and took a broad range of challenging courses at my prior high school or community college. Why wasn’t I admitted?\n",
      "Orginal Answer: Far more students apply to UC Santa Cruz than we can possibly admit. UC Santa Cruz is a selective campus and many qualified students are unable to be offered admission.\n",
      "Answer: I don't know.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: If I’m admitted from the waitlist, will I still be eligible for financial aid?\n",
      "Orginal Answer: Yes. If you applied for financial aid and submitted your FAFSA to UC Santa Cruz by the May 2 deadline, you will be able to receive information about your financial aid award prior to your admission acceptance deadline. \n",
      "Answer:  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: If I’m admitted from the waitlist, will I get my first-choice residential college?\n",
      "Orginal Answer: Just as with any of our incoming students, there is no guarantee of being assigned to your first-choice college. If admitted, you will receive your college assignment within approximately two weeks of accepting your offer of admission.\n",
      "Answer:  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Do students from the East Coast have a greater chance of being accepted than West Coast students?\n",
      "Orginal Answer: All first-year students, regardless of home geographic location, are reviewed and assessed using faculty-approved criteria, which can be found on our web page. UCSC seeks to admit and enroll students who will succeed at the university, including students from California and those from outside California.\n",
      "Answer: The context does not provide specific information about the acceptance rates for East Coast versus West Coast students at UCSC. It states that all first-year students are considered regardless of their geographic home. Therefore, I don't know if students from the East Coast have a greater chance of being accepted than West Coast students.\n",

      "Question: How do I request affiliation with a college and can I change it?\n",
      "Orginal Answer: When you have been admitted to UC Santa Cruz, you will specify in order of preference which colleges you would like to be affiliated with. Assignment to a college is based on available space, taking student preferences into account whenever possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is also possible to transfer to another college. In order for the transfer to be approved, the change must be approved by both the current college and the prospective college.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Transfer Community houses incoming transfer students who request university housing (regardless of college affiliation).\n",
      "Answer: To request affiliation with a college at UCSC, you need to accept the offer of admission, during which you can indicate your college preferences. All undergraduate students are affiliated with a college after admission. It is possible to change your college affiliation later, but specific procedures for doing so may vary.\n",
