This coverage will last until the start of the next academic calendar year. To enroll and purchase this continuation coverage, you will need to complete the Continuation Voluntary Enrollment forms. It is important to note that graduates who opt out of UC SHIP fees will not be eligible for the UC Health Insurance Grant. Additionally, graduates have the option to waive UC SHIP fees if they prefer to use their own insurance plan, but they must submit a waiver each academic year. If you have any specific questions or need clarification on your eligibility for UC SHIP post-graduation, it is recommended to contact the UC SHIP administration or the relevant university department for further guidance.',\n",

You can check with the UCSC Student Health Insurance Office or consult the website for the\\ncurrent cost of UC SHIP. Once you purchase three quarters (fall, winter and spring) you are covered for 12 months, until next fall. You can access health care anywhere in the world. Most\\nvisits to the SHC are free. Coverage outside of the SHC is excellent. Mental health care is strong. Some students may qualify for financial assistance from the UCSC Financial Aid Office to cover\\nsome or all of the costs of UC SHIP. You may contact the UCSC Financial Aid Office at (831)459-2963.\\nLearn more about UC SHIP at http://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/billing-insurance/insuranceinformation-2016-17.html You can work to switch your Medi-Cal to Santa Cruz County.  For Medi-Cal to cover you in Santa Cruz County, you need to change your permanent address to Santa Cruz County. To do this you must speak with your eligibility worker for Medi-Cal. Changing Medi-Cal to our county would work for the school year but may be a problem in the\\nsummer if you leave Santa Cruz. You could find that you need care at home but can only be seen in Santa Cruz. For some students it is important to maintain their permanent address for other\\nreasons.\\n2. You can purchase a private insurance plan and drop Medi-Cal.\\nThere are other suitable health insurance options that can be purchased that will meet the UC requirements.\\nWhere to go with Medi-Cal in Santa Cruz (call first to verify eligibility and availability):\\nSanta Cruz Community Health Centers 831-427-3500\\nPlanned Parenthood (Pacific Ave) 831-426-5500\\nSalud para La Gente (Beach Flats Clinic and many locations in Watsonville) 831-423-0222\\nDon’t get yourself in a mess with medical bills:\\nSpeak with someone. Our insurance advocates, Diane Mesa, Astrid Shannon and Michelle Michaels are experts in medical insurance and can help answer questions about UC SHIP, and can\\nhelp with any other insurance including Medi-Cal. Contact them by emailing insure@ucsc.edu. The Dean of Students Office can also be helpful (831-502-7031). Call someone, bring all the\\nbills, statements and notices you’ve got and we will help you sort them out.\\nConsider CruzCare\\nIf you successfully waived UC SHIP and do have providers in the area, you might consider purchasing CruzCare, which provides inexpensive pre-paid, convenient access to the SHC, and\\nkeep your local Medi-Cal. CruzCare costs $100 a quarter and gives you unlimited visits for illness or injury at the SHC free of charge. While this is a great option, it does not take care of\\neverything – it has some significant limitations. Any tests that we can run in our building (X-ray and limited Laboratory) are included in CruzCare. CruzCare does not cover medicines nor\\nmedical supplies. You could use your Medi-Cal card at any off-campus retail pharmacy. CruzCare does not cover mental health services. CruzCare only works at the SHC. If you have a\\nserious health problem and need to be seen outside of the SHC, CruzCare will not work. In these cases you would need to use your Medi-Cal.

The requirement applies to graduate, undergraduate, and\\ninternational students. UC students are automatically enrolled in the University’s student health insurance\\nplan unless their request to waive enrollment is approved.\\nHistory\\nBefore health insurance was a requirement, the University witnessed sky‐rocketing costs of medical insurance\\nand increasing numbers of students with no health insurance. Medical debt was a key factor in students\\ndropping out of school.\\nIn response to these conditions, the Regents of the University of California approved a recommendation by the\\nCommittee on Educational Policy to require health insurance for all undergraduate students, effective\\nSeptember, 2001, and approved a similar program for all registered graduate students of the University in\\nNovember of 2009. To implement the mandatory program, and in response to the University’s best practices\\ninitiative, a student health insurance plan (UC SHIP) was established, to leverage the purchasing power of the\\nUniversity to provide strong benefits at an affordable cost.\\nStudents who already have medical insurance that satisfies the established coverage criteria through a domestic\\ninsurance company may apply to waive enrollment in UC SHIP for one academic year. Criteria established by the\\nUniversity of California for medical insurance must be met in order to waive enrollment in UC SHIP. Please go\\nto www.ucop.edu/ucship and click on your campus link to review waiver criteria established for 2012‐13.\\nStudent Program\\nUC SHIP is a comprehensive program including medical, behavioral health, and pharmacy coverage; dental and\\nvision coverage are included in the package on most campuses. This program was designed especially for\\nstudents and offers excellent benefits at a low cost. Health insurance is available on a voluntary basis for eligible\\ndependents of students enrolled in UC SHIP.

The requirement applies to graduate, undergraduate, and\\ninternational students. UC students are automatically enrolled in the University’s student health insurance\\nplan unless their request to waive enrollment is approved.\\nHistory\\nBefore health insurance was a requirement, the University witnessed sky‐rocketing costs of medical insurance\\nand increasing numbers of students with no health insurance. Medical debt was a key factor in students\\ndropping out of school.\\nIn response to these conditions, the Regents of the University of California approved a recommendation by the\\nCommittee on Educational Policy to require health insurance for all undergraduate students, effective\\nSeptember, 2001, and approved a similar program for all registered graduate students of the University in\\nNovember of 2009. To implement the mandatory program, and in response to the University’s best practices\\ninitiative, a student health insurance plan (UC SHIP) was established, to leverage the purchasing power of the\\nUniversity to provide strong benefits at an affordable cost.\\nStudents who already have medical insurance that satisfies the established coverage criteria through a domestic\\ninsurance company may apply to waive enrollment in UC SHIP for one academic year. Criteria established by the\\nUniversity of California for medical insurance must be met in order to waive enrollment in UC SHIP. Please go\\nto www.ucop.edu/ucship and click on your campus link to review waiver criteria established for 2012‐13.\\nStudent Program\\nUC SHIP is a comprehensive program including medical, behavioral health, and pharmacy coverage; dental and\\nvision coverage are included in the package on most campuses. This program was designed especially for\\nstudents and offers excellent benefits at a low cost. Health insurance is available on a voluntary basis for eligible\\ndependents of students enrolled in UC SHIP.
